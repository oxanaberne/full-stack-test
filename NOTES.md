# Development Notes

- Decided to skip the image upload feature because I prefered focused my time on the rest of the core feature, but I still did a random assigment (but consistente and saved to database) of image so there is still a variaty in the display of the item. In the same way, I've choosen to do a random assignation of the image as an avatar image.


### Removed element
- Supabase-only backend (removed Express backend)
- Removed not used images:

Notes :
- The commits are sprend through the day at various time because I had commitments in my day and couldn't be free for 6-10 hours straight. But I still started and finished the assesment in the same day timeline
- Really liked working on this assessment, I have discovered Supabase and it was a really nice discovery! So practical, I will definetly look into it some more in my free time.
